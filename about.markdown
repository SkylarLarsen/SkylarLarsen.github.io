## Graduate Education

I work with my advisors **Dr. Nikole Lewis** and **Dr. Jake Turner** to characterize exoplanet super-Earths and mini-Neptunes! 

My current research focus is **characterizing the orbital and planetary parameters of super-Earth and sub-Neptune exoplanets** to constrain their instellations and orbital velocities, which inform whether the exoplanet is expected to retain an atmosphere. To do this, I wrote and currently maintain a code program designed to identify individual exoplanet tranists in TESS sector data. I use this code along with the [EXOplanet MOdeling Package (EXOMOP)](https://github.com/astrojake/EXOMOP) to refine exoplanet parameters. 

I have acquired substantial teaching experience while in graduate school as a **teaching assistant** for Cornell Astronomy Undergraduate classes ASTRO 1101 (From New Worlds to Black Holes) and ASTRO 1102 (Our Solar System). As a teaching assistant, I hold weekly discussion sections with students and office hours, grade homework, and proctor exams. Additionally, I have participated in multiple **public outreach** opportunities while in grad school, including co-hosting a presentation on the search for life in the universe for [New York State 4-H](https://www.nys4-h.org/) students and volunteering for the Museum in the Dark outreach event at Ithaca’s [Museum of the Earth](https://www.museumoftheearth.org/).

In graduate school at Cornell, I have taken a number of relevant courses to my research, including Planetary Atmospheres, Physics of the Planets, and Climate Dynamics. I successfully completed my first graduate Qualifying Exam (my Q-exam) in August 2024. 


## Undergraduate Education

**I earned my B.S. in Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences from MIT in 2023.** My undergraduate focuses, planetary science and data analysis, have uniquely prepared me for my Ph.D research by providing me with extensive, specialized academic and technical background in **astronomy and Python coding.** As part of my time at MIT, I conducted astrometry research at MIT's [Wallace Astrophysical Observatory](https://web.mit.edu/wallace/) to track Koronis family asteroids and monitor their rotational periods.

At MIT, I was both a student and a mentor! I was an experienced calculus teaching assistant (TA) for three years in MIT’s [Experimental Study Group (ESG)](https://esg.mit.edu/), where I received the **Peter and Sharon Fiekowsky Award for Excellence in Teaching** at ESG in June of 2023, which is awarded solely based on student votes.

## NASA Internship Experience

I have had the incredible opportunity to intern at multiple planetary science and astronomy institutions. I interned at NASA’s [Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI)](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/)  during Summer 2021, where I studied the chemical compositions of near-Earth asteroids in an attempt to detect water on their surfaces. I developed crucial research skills such as scientific writing, presentation proficiency, and experience with the coding languages Python and IDL through my work and by presenting my findings at the **Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference (LPSC)** and the **Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS)** conference in 2021. 

My work at the LPI was so enjoyable that I refined my 2021 research into my MIT undergraduate thesis and returned to work at **NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC)** in 2023.  At the JSC, I was able to immerse myself in the wider scientific community by honing my data analysis skills, making connections with active NASA mission staff, working with rock samples in the JSC soils lab, and aiding in late-night remote spectroscopy observations at NASA’ [Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF)](https://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/). I presented my JSC internship findings at the 2023 DPS conference.
 
## Boyce-Astro

I got my astronomy start in high school with the [Boyce-Astro](https://boyce-astro.org/) DoubleStars program in San Diego, which provides high school and college students with research experience working with double star astrometry, resulting in publications in the Journal of Double Star Observations (JDSO). The program gave me experience with the [Washington Double Star Catalog](https://www.astro.gsu.edu/wds/) and the AstroImageJ software. I was able to publish two papers via the program before returning as a mentor!
