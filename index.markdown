My name is Skylar Larsen, and I am a graduate student at the Cornell University Department of Astronomy. I specialize in observational data analysis of exoplanet transits on the Cosmic Shoreline. I investigate how exoplanet orbital and planetary processes affect which planets retain their atmospheres.
